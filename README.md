# Rune Rooms

Rune rooms is a mod for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance that adds a new kind of room: Rune Rooms.

These rooms have a chance to replace vault rooms. Inside them you'll find a huge runic crystal that may be activated by pressing the pads in the room for a positive effect.

# For mod developers

Rune rooms adds a bunch of helper functions and callbacks to help other mods be compatible.
